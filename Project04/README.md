# Introduction

We will implement one of the primary assembly algorithms from short-read data that is used today, using a simple form of the algorithm where we *assume perfect sequencing*. That is, everything is sequenced exacty once and there are no errors or variants in the sequencing.

A graph is composed of **nodes** and **edges** and we will need to develop a data strcture to track edges between nodes in our graph. We have been provided with the basic class structure as well as descriptions of functions to `add_edge` and `remove_edge` from the graph. We will need to implement these functions in order to then build the de Bruijn graph.

In our implementation, we use a `defaultdict` data structure to hold a list of all edges in the graph where all "right" nodes connected to a "left" node are stored in a list for that node.

# Pseudocode

## Add Edge

```         

function add_edge(self, left, right):
        dictionary[left].append(right)
        return dictionary
```

## Remove Edge

```         
function remove_edge(self, left, right):
        dictionary[left].remove(right)
        return dictionary
```

## Build de Bruijn Graph

```         

function build_debruijn_graph(self, input string, k):
dictionary = {}
  For each kmer of input string:
      left <- string[0:k]
      right <- string[1:k+1]
      add_edge(left,right)   
      #add k-1 mers as nodes with a directed edge from left k-1 mer to right k-1 mer
  return dictionary
```

## Print Eulerian Walk

```         
function print_eularian_walk(self, seed = None):
        if seed is not None:
                set random seed  # random.seed(seed)

        first_node <- randomly select node
        return eularian_walk(first_node, seed)
        
```

## Eularian Walk

```         
#V1.0 - recursion
function eulerian_walk(node, seed = None):
        if seed is given:
                set seed
                
        tour <- add node to the list 
        edge <- randomly selected edge from dictionary  #random.choice?
        remove edge from node in the dictionary
        set the edge as the next node
        if the node has an empty list
                return tour
        else  # recurse
                next_tour <- eularian_walk(node)  # store next node and edge
                return tour + next_tour  # combine lists
                
#V1.1 - recursion
function eulerian_walk(node, seed = None):
        if seed is not None
                set seed
        
        if the node has an empty list
                return the node as a list
        
        tour <- add node to the list 
        edge <- randomly selected edge from dictionary
        remove edge from node in the dictionary
        
        next_tour <- recursion call using the edge as the next node
        return tour + next tour
        
  ABCAC
  tour: [A,B]
  next_tour 1: [B,C]
  next_tour 2: [C,A]
  next_tour 3: [A,C]
  tour: [C,A,A,C]
  tour: [B,C,C,A,A,C]
  tour: [A,B,B,C,C,A,A,C]
  ABCAC
